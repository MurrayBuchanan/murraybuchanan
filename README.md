## Hello, World!

Classic, amirite!?

Welcome to my profile.
I’m Murray. I work mostly on infrastructure and large-scale systems. Over the last few years that’s meant a lot of time in AWS, Azure, and GCP, building and operating servers, storage, and networks that actually scale.

I’ve worked with a range of tech stacks, but I’m mainly interested in solving problems that are genuinely useful.
